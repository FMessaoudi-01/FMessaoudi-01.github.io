Greetings, Humans;

This is Fatma Messaoudi, I go by Alienbot which is a rather cool alias my younger self came up with when I first stepped into the realm of cybersecurity about six years ago.

This space is where I share my Cybersecurity and Web3 Security Projects [Cybersecurity Projects](http://localhost:4000/projects/){: .btn .btn--primary} not as tutorials, but as evidence of how I think.

I hold a Master’s Degree in Computer Science (Networks and Information Systems), but that never stopped me from keeping my passion alive and teaching myself cybersecurity — from ethical hacking to blue team operations. Along the way, I’ve earned certifications from TCM Security, EC-Council, Fortinet, and Security Blue Team, and ranked in the top 1% on TryHackMe.

My experience spans hands-on labs in Active Directory hacking, penetration testing, and SOC analysis, alongside my current full-time role as a Cybersecurity Engineer at a Tier 1 company.

Lately, I’ve been diving deep into Web3 security, auditing smart contracts, learning Solidity and Rust, and preparing for bounties on Immunefi and competitive audit platforms. My approach hasn’t changed: understand systems from the inside out, find that one logic bug that could break something, and exploit it. In fact, that’s how I found my first bug in Web3 security.

Mindset: I learn fast, think deeply, and most importantly, I see patterns where others see chaos. That’s my favorite part.
